       "AIMessage(content='\\n<think>\\nOkay, the user is asking, \"What is throngs?\" Let me start by recalling what I know about the word \"throngs.\" I think it\\'s a noun, and it refers to a large crowd of people. But I should make sure I\\'m accurate here.\\n\\nFirst, I should check the definition. \"Throngs\" is the plural of \"throng,\" which means a dense crowd or a large number of people gathered together. It\\'s often used in a literary or descriptive context to emphasize the size and perhaps the movement of the crowd. \\n\\nWait, maybe I should confirm if there are other meanings. Sometimes words can have different definitions depending on context. But I believe in most cases, \"throngs\" refers to crowds. Let me think of example sentences. Like, \"Throngs of people gathered in the广场 to watch the parade.\" That makes sense. \\n\\nAre there any synonyms? Crowds, masses, gatherings, assemblages. But \"throng\" specifically implies a pressing or dense group. Maybe it\\'s used more in writing than in everyday speech. \\n\\nAlso, could \"throng\" be a verb? Yes, actually. The verb form means to gather in large numbers. For example, \"People thronged the streets.\" But the user asked about \"throngs,\" which is the noun form.\\n\\nI should also note that \"throngs\" is always plural. You can\\'t say \"a throng of people\" is incorrect? Wait no, \"a throng of people\" is correct, but \"throngs\" would be multiple groups or just emphasizing the large number. Hmm, perhaps better to explain both noun and verb forms briefly, but focus on the noun as the question is about \"throngs.\"\\n\\nExamples in sentences would help clarify. Maybe historical or media contexts where the term is used. Like news articles reporting \"Throngs of supporters attended the event.\" \\n\\nAlso, are there any common phrases or idioms with \"throng\"? Not that I can think of immediately. Probably just used straightforwardly.\\n\\nWait, could there be any confusion with similar-sounding words? Like \"throng\" vs. \"thorough\"? Probably not, but just to be safe, stick to the definition.\\n\\nI should also mention the etymology if possible. The origin might be from Old English or another Germanic root. Let me recall: \"throng\" comes from Old English \"thring,\" meaning a press or crowd, from the verb \"þrynnan,\" to press. That\\'s from the Proto-Germanic *thringaz. So it\\'s an old word with a solid etymology related to pressing together.\\n\\nSo putting it all together, \"throngs\" refers to large, dense groups of people, often used to emphasize the size and movement of the crowd. It\\'s a noun, plural, and can be used in both positive and negative contexts, like describing a busy event or a chaotic scene.\\n\\nWait, does \"throngs\" ever refer to non-human things? Like animals? Probably not typically. It\\'s mainly people. Though maybe in a figurative sense, but I think the primary use is for people.\\n\\nI should also note that it\\'s a countable noun. So \"throngs of protesters\" or \"throngs of tourists.\" \\n\\nAlright, I think that\\'s a solid understanding. Now, structure the answer clearly, starting with the definition, examples, usage, synonyms, and maybe the verb form. But keep it concise as per the user\\'s request. Avoid unnecessary details unless needed. The user might be looking for a quick definition, so start with the straightforward answer first.\\n</think>\\n\\n**Throngs** refers to a large, dense crowd or gathering of people, often emphasizing their numerousness and sometimes their movement or activity. It is typically used to describe scenes where many individuals are congregated in one place, such as at an event, protest, or public space. \\n\\n### Key points:\\n- **Definition**: A throng is a mass of people crowded closely together. The plural \"throngs\" can refer to multiple such gatherings or a single large crowd (e.g., \"throngs of protesters filled the square\").\\n- **Usage**: Common in descriptive or journalistic contexts. Example: \"Throngs of fans gathered outside the concert venue.\"\\n- **Synonyms**: Crowds, masses, multitudes, hordes, assemblies.\\n- **Verb form**: \"Throng\" can also be a verb meaning to gather in large numbers (e.g., \"Fans thronged the streets\").\\n\\n### Etymology:\\nThe word originates from Old English *þryng*, meaning \"press\" or \"crowd,\" reflecting its roots in the idea of people gathering tightly.\\n\\nThis term is often used for dramatic effect to underscore the scale or intensity of a crowd\\'s presence.', additional_kwargs={}, response_metadata={'token_usage': {'completion_tokens': 977, 'prompt_tokens': 15, 'total_tokens': 992, 'completion_time': 2.212018799, 'prompt_time': 0.002886441, 'queue_time': 0.26294848099999996, 'total_time': 2.21490524}, 'model_name': 'qwen-qwq-32b', 'system_fingerprint': 'fp_a91d9c2cfb', 'finish_reason': 'stop', 'logprobs': None}, id='run--15bcc642-0d7b-42e0-9c15-29fb1e6f85aa-0', usage_metadata={'input_tokens': 15, 'output_tokens': 977, 'total_tokens': 992})"
